This is our submission for the python mini project. It is a Disaster tweet prediction program that recognizes if a tweet is about an actual disaster or not.
Packages used: Tensorflow Keras, Re, Numpy, Pandas.

Applications
-Improving disaster response: By analyzing tweets related to disasters in real-time,
disaster response teams can get a better understanding of the situation on the ground
and respond more effectively.

social media during disasters, emergency managers can tailor their communication
strategies to better reach and inform the public.
